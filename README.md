# Entity-Framework-Poc
Proof of concept using Entity Framework Code First (with help of EF Power Tools) and Database First approaches.

## References

For the code first approach, I used the "Entity Framework Power Tools" to make my life easier. It will generate the mappings from an existing database. After executed it, you can fix manually the mappings.
